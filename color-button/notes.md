# Course notes

- Better to use roles than text, as screen readers use roles
- Can look online to see a list of all the roles available to you
- If you have multiple elements with the same role, you can use name to find the text on that specific element
- If you can't find an element in the way a screenreader does, then it won't be accessible for a user
